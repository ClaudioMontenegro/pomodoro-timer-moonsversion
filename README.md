In the Python 28/100 challenge, I had to recreate the famous Pomodoro's timer with my own style. 
Pomodoro means tomato in Italian, and is generally the symbol that represents the timer. 
Thinking about a nice and comfortable GUI, I created the "lunar" version of the program (Pomodoro Timer - Moon's Version ðŸ¤£). 
In this program, I used the Tkinter package to create a GUI. Furthermore, I used the wonderful ImageFu website (https://reviewgrower.com/button-and-badge-generator/) 
to create more designed buttons, which visually matched what I imagined for the interface.
